POST-IT NOTE VERSION – GNS3 ALL-TECH LAB

LAN1: VLANs 1/10/11/22/33.
Don’t forget LAN1-SW2 exists.
R1 = inter-VLAN router. CE1 → MPLS.

LAN2: MSTP domain (241–243).
R2 + CE2 → MPLS.
PC7 lives here.

DC: VPC pair. No DHCP relay.
ARP weirdness w/ MSTP.

MPLS: Check LDP + vpnv4.
VRFs = CE1 + CE2.
Routes must appear on PEs.

ASA VPN: Crypto-map.
Needs NAT exemption, mirrored crypto ACLs.
If SA up but traffic fails → ASA routing after decrypt.

Quick checks:

PC → default gateway?

CE neighbors up?

VRF routes on PEs?

ASA: show crypto isa/ipsec sa

packet-tracer

Quirks:
– ASA SSH needs ssh-rsa.
– VPC ↔ MSTP ARP bugs.
– SLA needed to auto-bring tunnels up.

One-liner:
Two LANs, two ASAs, MPLS core, VPN backup; VLAN10 SVI on SW2; watch routes + NAT.
